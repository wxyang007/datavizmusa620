## Introduction

This project visualizes car crashes in Boston (2015-2019) and their potential contributing factors--income level of the surrounding area, general transit mode, and location types, in an attempt to assist policymaking processes of reducing the number of car crashes.

Codes for achieving the following visualizations can be found in this [Jupyter notebook]().



## Data and Methods

### Methods and Workflow

There are many potential contributing factors to car crashes. Among various possibilities, occurrence of car crashes could be influenced by the condition of surrounding environment, or may be pre-determined to an extent by the type of road or transit mode that people take.

Therefore, the objective of this study is to analyze the relationships between car crashes and several potential factors using data visualization. Specifically, car crashes in Boston by month are plotted first for the purpose of examining their general spatial distribution. Then, clustering of car crashes from 2015 to 2019 are analyzed in comparison with a choropleth map of median household income by census tract, where median household income is a proxy of the differences in surrounding environment. Finally, time series of the number of car crashes with different transit mode and location type are plotted.

Workflow of this project can be summarized as 1) data accessing and trimming, and 2) data visualizations. All of the steps are done in Python (Jupyter notebook).


### Packages Used

1 for data processing


* Accessing API
  - requests
  - io (StringIO)
  - census_area (Census): This is used to access data provided by the Census Bureau. An API key is needed before acquiring data (which can be applied online), and the dictionary of code to data can be found through this [link](https://api.census.gov/data/2017/acs/acs5/variables.html).
* Trim data
  - pandas
  - geopandas
  - datetime
  - shapely



2 for data visualization

* Folium: A Python version of Leaflet
  - Heatmap with time
  - Marker cluster

* Branca: A package that is used to generate style function in this project

* Altair: Interactive graph making


### Car Crash Data

Car crash data is acquired through API of [Boston Vision Zero Crashes Records](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/vision-zero-crash-records), which can be seen as follows.

### Median Income Level by Census Tract

Median household income by census tract is accessed through Census API.


## Results

### Heatmap With Time (Folium)

Below is a map that is a collection of heatmaps of car crashes by month, 2015 to 2019.

<div id="f1"></div>

Clustering appears all the time despite slight change of location throughout the months. Therefore, it is very likely that different locations have different car crash incidents. The remaining question is what part in particular is contributing.

### Income Choropleth & Crashes Cluster (Folium & Branca)

Below is an overlay of income choropleth map with cluster of total crashes. Bluer tracts indicate higher income level.

<div id="f2"></div>

At the default zoom level, there are six large clusters of crashes in Boston, all of which are not located in very blue areas, which supports the assumption that the number of car crashes is related with surrounding environment--in this case, income level.

### Car Crashes VS Transit Mode & Location Type (Altair)

To analyze the relationships between car crashes with transit mode and location type, a chart that shows the number (and proportion) of crashes that occurred in different transit modes ('ped'=pedestrian, 'mv'=motor vehicle, and 'bike'=bike) and location types (street, intersection, and other) by year is created.


<div id ="a1"></div>

Despite differences in year, most crashes occurred with motor vehicles, then pedestrians, and then bikes, which could be related with the number of people using these transit modes. Meanwhile, there are almost always more crashes that occurred on intersections than anywhere else (including streets).

### Car Crashes VS Transit Mode & Time (Altair)

A further look is taken into the relationship between car crashes with transit modes and location types respectively.

## Concluding Remarks

Future improvement may include introducing more variables and combining these visualizations into a single 'app'.
