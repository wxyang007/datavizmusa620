This project visualizes car crashes in Boston and their potential contributing factors--income level of the surrounding area, transportation mode, and different types of locations, to assist policymaking process to reduce car crashes.

A basic introduction on how to achieve these through jupyter notebook can be found in this [Jupyter notebook]().

## Introduction
